# SEB
SEB is a cost-effective, safety-focused wearable device for activities like adventure sports and swimming.

A large problem faced by public spaces which have a time limit, such as public swimming pools, is that many people try to extend their use of the placee. This means that thereâ€™s often overuse of public resources and needs to be addressed. This is one problem we tackle with our solution.
Extreme adventure sports like rock climbing, trekking, skiing, caving, etc are often intensely isolating. This makes them much more dangerous than they need be. However the only available equipment and gadgets for these sports are unnecessarily complicated and expensive. Needing a great deal of mastery as well as capital to be used. This creates a desperate need for cheap, affordable and accessible equipment to ease the problem.

The Secure Emergency Band (SEB) is a specialized wearable designed to enhance safety in high-risk environments, including adventure sports and swimming activities. Its unique features include a timer function that activates when worn; if time runs out, the band alerts a control room, allowing lifeguards or security personnel to respond promptly. The SEB also includes a GPS-enabled SOS button for quick distress signals, enabling users to call for help instantly in emergency situations.

For continuous health monitoring, SEB has a heart rate sensor that detects abnormalities. If a sudden drop or spike in heart rate occurs, the band automatically sends an alert to ensure immediate medical attention. All data is transmitted in real-time to a control room through a dedicated web interface, where personnel can monitor multiple users, ensuring comprehensive oversight and timely assistance. The SEB offers advanced life-saving features at an affordable cost, making it accessible and practical for diverse applications, from public pools to rugged outdoor sports.
